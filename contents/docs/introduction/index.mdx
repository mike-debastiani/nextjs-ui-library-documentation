## About me

My name is **Mike De Bastiani**, and I am currently studying **Digital Ideation** at the Lucerne University of Applied Sciences and Arts.  

At the start of this mentorship, I was in my 4th semester and brought with me an advanced background in **UX/UI design**, along with solid skills in 
HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and Tailwind CSS. While I had some experience with Angular, I had limited exposure to modern frameworks like **React** or **Next.js** – which I was able to explore and expand significantly during this project.


This project was developed during the **MENT4.FS25** module – a self-directed mentorship format in which students work independently on a project relevant to their field.  

_The mentorship was guided by Nick Niles._



## Motivation

Most of my previous academic and professional work has focused on UX and UI. However, I believe that a more in-depth understanding of frontend development strengthens design quality and bridges the gap between concept and implementation.  

To pursue this goal, I decided to focus on **Next.js** as a modern frontend framework and apply it in a practical setting.

## Project Structure

I approached the mentorship in two main phases.
