These components provide visual cues that inform users about the state of the interface, highlight important information, or offer contextual help. They support **usability**, **clarity**, and **user guidance** across your application.

## Components Overview

- [Alerts](/docs/ui-components/feedback-status/alerts)  
- [Badges](/docs/ui-components/feedback-status/badges)  
- [Tooltips](/docs/ui-components/feedback-status/tooltips)

## Why Feedback & Status Components Matter

Good feedback mechanisms help users:

- **Understand what’s happening** – success, errors, warnings, or informational states  
- **React appropriately** – make informed decisions based on real-time context  
- **Stay oriented** – navigate the interface with greater confidence and clarity

These components are lightweight but powerful in terms of user perception and experience.

## Getting Started

To include a component from this category, follow these steps:

1. Navigate to the component page from the Overview above.  
2. Copy the **Full Code** block to your project.  
3. Adjust the **Props** and **Variants** to match your needs  
4. Place the component in your UI wherever real-time feedback or guidance is needed

Use feedback components consistently to build trust and create a more intuitive, responsive user experience.
