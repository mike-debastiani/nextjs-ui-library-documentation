Composite components combine multiple atomic or foundational elements into reusable blocks of functionality. They demonstrate how individual UI components can be orchestrated into meaningful, higher-level patterns that reflect real-world use cases.

## Why Composite Components Matter

These components:

- **Show practical integration** – demonstrating how smaller building blocks work together  
- **Support real use cases** – such as authentication, user onboarding, or settings management  
- **Promote consistency** – by reusing predefined styles, behaviors, and interaction patterns

They bridge the gap between basic components and real-world applications.

## Getting Started

To include a composite component in your project:

1. Navigate to the component page from the Overview above.  
2. Copy the **Full Code** block into your project.  
3. Ensure all internal components (e.g. `Button`, `Input`, `Checkbox`) are properly imported  
4. Customize the structure or logic as needed to fit your product context

Composite components offer a valuable way to prototype real UI flows with consistent building blocks.
