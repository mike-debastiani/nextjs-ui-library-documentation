## Learnings

Throughout this mentorship, I gained a deeper understanding of modern frontend development and the technologies that power it.

- **JavaScript Fundamentals**  
  Learning JavaScript basics provided a smooth and motivating entry point. It laid a strong foundation and helped me approach more complex topics with confidence.

- **Understanding Frameworks**  
  Exploring how modern frameworks like React and Next.js work gave me insight into the structure of today's frontend applications – and showed that each abstraction comes with its own complexity.

- **Component-Based Thinking**  
  Building UI components from scratch fostered a more modular and reusable mindset, which benefits both my development practice and my approach to scalable design systems.

- **Broader Technical Awareness**  
  While focusing on Next.js and Tailwind CSS, I also engaged with adjacent technologies like JSX, MDX, Git, and GitHub workflows. This broadened my technical vocabulary and made me more confident in using real-world development tools.

## Challenges

Alongside the progress, the project was filled with unexpected hurdles that required flexibility and persistence.

- **Navigating Complexity**  
  As I moved beyond the basics, I quickly encountered the depth and intricacy of frameworks like React and Next.js. What first appeared manageable turned out to be a vast ecosystem – and staying focused on what was relevant to this mentorship became a constant balancing act.

- **Shifting from Design to Development**  
  Coming from a design-focused background, working with frontend code introduced a new and sometimes overwhelming set of mental models – from component rendering and client/server behavior to TypeScript syntax and build processes.

- **Setup & Debugging Issues**  
  Getting the documentation site up and running posed several technical challenges, particularly during deployment via Vercel. What worked locally often failed during build due to small issues like missing imports or case-sensitive file paths. Solving these problems was time-consuming but taught me valuable debugging techniques.

- **Overload of New Concepts**  
  To keep the project moving, I had to engage with tools and topics beyond the original scope – including MDX formatting, dynamic routing, and Git workflows. While these may be routine for experienced developers, for me they represented steep, unfamiliar territory.

## Conclusion

This mentoring project has been a challenging yet rewarding journey into modern frontend development. What began as a desire to broaden my development skills evolved into a structured and hands-on learning process that pushed me well beyond my comfort zone.

By dividing the project into two phases, I was able to first build a foundational understanding of JavaScript, React, and Next.js, and then apply this knowledge in a practical setting by developing a personal UI component library. This not only helped me internalize technical concepts, but also deepened my understanding of how design and development intersect in real-world applications.

One of the most valuable takeaways was learning how frontend frameworks work behind the scenes and how interactive components can be documented and reused effectively.

While the process wasn’t without obstacles, each challenge led to meaningful growth. I now feel more equipped to communicate with developers, work collaboratively across disciplines, and continue building on this technical foundation. This mentorship has shown me that stepping into new territory, especially with curiosity and commitment, can lead to some of the most impactful learning experiences.

Thank you for your support and guidance, Nick!
