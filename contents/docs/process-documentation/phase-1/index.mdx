  <StepItem title="Getting Started with JavaScript Fundamentals">
    In the first phase of this mentorship, I focused on strengthening my understanding of core JavaScript concepts.  
    
    To do so, I used a mix of high-quality and sometimes interactive learning platforms:

    - [MDN Web Docs Curriculum](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/curriculum/)
    - [Scrimba: JavaScript Basics](https://scrimba.com/learn-javascript-c0v)
    - [web.dev: JavaScript Course](https://web.dev/learn/javascript)
    - [JavaScript.info](https://javascript.info/)

    Among these, **Scrimba** stood out for its interactive video format: it allows learners to write code directly within the lesson context.  
    However, some parts of the course are locked behind a paywall, unlike the others which are fully free to access.

    The key topics I focused on included:

    - Variables & Data Types  
    - Operators  
    - Control Structures  
    - Functions  
    - Arrays & Objects  
    - Events & DOM Manipulation  
    - Basic Error Handling  
    - Clean Code & Best Practices
  </StepItem>

  <StepItem title="Exploring Frontend Frameworks & Tech Stack Research">
    With a better grasp of JavaScript, I began exploring how modern frontend frameworks are structured and how logic flows within them.  
    I also spent time researching current industry trends by analyzing job postings on [jobs.ch](https://jobs.ch), focusing on required frameworks and tools.

    Frameworks that appeared most often included:

    - React  
    - Next.js  
    - Angular  
    - Vue.js  

    For CSS frameworks, **Tailwind CSS** and **Bootstrap** were frequently mentioned.

    Based on this research and my project needs, I decided to work with **Next.js** in combination with **Tailwind CSS**.  
    This decision was based on several reasons:

    - Next.js is **React-based**, but offers more structure, routing, and server-side features out of the box  
    - Tailwind CSS fits well with component-based development and enforces consistent design through utility classes  
    - Both tools are **well-documented, community-supported**, and reflect current industry standards  
    - Next.js projects can be **set up quickly** and deployed effortlessly through [**Vercel**](https://vercel.com/), with seamless GitHub integration
  </StepItem>

  <StepItem title="Switching to TypeScript and Embracing Modern Syntax">
    Although I initially focused on JavaScript, I decided early on to work with **TypeScript** for this project.  
    
    Despite the change, I found that the logic I learned translated well to TypeScript syntax and allowed me to continue working confidently within my chosen stack

    Working with TypeScript also aligned with many professional projects and job requirements I encountered during my research.
  </StepItem>

  <StepItem title="Learning React & Next.js through Practice">
    With my stack chosen, I worked through the official tutorials at [nextjs.org/learn](https://nextjs.org/learn), which start with **React fundamentals** and continue into **Next.js basics**.  
    These tutorials use a small but hands-on project structure, helping me understand:

    - Component-based development in React  
    - Props, state, and events  
    - File-based routing in Next.js  
    - Pages, layouts, and the App Router  
    - Styling and structure with Tailwind CSS

    After completing these resources, I had a clear conceptual and technical foundation and felt confident enough to move on to the next phase.
