<Step>

  <StepItem title="Defining the Documentation Strategy">
    To kick off this phase, I first researched how existing UI libraries structure and document their components.  
    
    I examined popular projects like [shadcn/ui](https://ui.shadcn.com/) and [Radix UI](https://www.radix-ui.com/) to understand best practices for showcasing components clearly and consistently.

    This made it clear to me that I would need a proper documentation page to collect and present my components. While tools like [Storybook](https://storybook.js.org/) were an option, I deliberately chose to build the documentation site myself in order to **maximize the learning effect**.
  </StepItem>

  <StepItem title="Setting Up the Documentation Website">
    I selected the [Documents Starter Template](https://vercel.com/templates/documentation/documents-simple-next-js-documentation) by Rubix Studios as the base and started customizing it using **Next.js** and **Tailwind CSS**.

    Initially, the setup was challenging. Navigating through the folder structure, routing logic, and component system felt overwhelming – especially when working with the **App Router** and **TypeScript**.  
    However, by breaking things down and testing frequently, I managed to adapt the layout and logic to suit my goals.

    The site structure included:
    - A sidebar with categorized component links
    - A responsive layout with a header and content area
    - Pages created via MDX to document each UI component
  </StepItem>

  <StepItem title="Designing the Page Layout for Components">
    Once the base was in place, I focused on defining a consistent documentation layout for each component.  
    
    Inspired by other libraries, I established the following structure:

    1. **Preview & Code Tabs** – Interactive preview of the component and a tab to view the full TSX + Tailwind code  
    2. **Setup & Usage** – A guide to create and integrate the component  
    3. **Props Reference** – Description of available props and how to use them  
    4. **Examples & Variants** – Practical use cases and alternative versions

    Implementing the tab logic required modifying the existing Tab component in the template. I had to learn how **Client Components** work in Next.js, and how they differ from Server Components – especially for live interaction.
  </StepItem>

  <StepItem title="Choosing and Categorizing Components">
    After building the first example page, I planned the full list of components to implement.  
    
    I grouped them into three main categories:

    - **Form Controls**: Basic interactive inputs like buttons, checkboxes, and text fields  
    - **Feedback & Status**: Elements like alerts, badges, and tooltips  
    - **Composite Components**: Larger UI blocks built from smaller elements, such as login cards or settings forms

    This categorization was inspired by the principles of **Atomic Design** by Brad Frost. Atomic Design proposes a hierarchy from smallest units (atoms like buttons) to more complex organisms and templates.  
    
    My structure maps well to this idea, helping me separate concerns and build reusable, modular components. However, my implementation does not strictly follow the atomic structure – for example, some of the so-called "atom" components already include labels or descriptions, which technically makes them closer to molecules.
  </StepItem>

  <StepItem title="Developing the Form Control Components">
    I began by implementing components in the "Form Controls" category.  
    
    I challenged myself to build each one from scratch using only my current understanding. I used ChatGPT only for specific questions when I was stuck or needed best practices.

    Components developed in this phase included:
    - Button  
    - Checkbox  
    - Radio Button  
    - Select Dropdown  
    - Switch  
    - Text Input  
    - Textarea  
  </StepItem>

  <StepItem title="Deploying the Documentation with Vercel">
    Once I had several components ready, I attempted to deploy the project via [Vercel](https://vercel.com/).  
    
    Although everything worked fine locally, I ran into multiple build errors during deployment.

    After hours of debugging and checking imports, I eventually discovered that **a folder with the wrong casing** (e.g. lowercase vs uppercase) was not pushed correctly to GitHub.  
    This seemingly small issue caused imports to fail on the Vercel build system.

    Once corrected, I was able to deploy a working version of the documentation successfully.
  </StepItem>

  <StepItem title="Finalizing the Component Library">
    With the core structure in place and deployment working, I progressively added more components – including those in the Feedback and Composite categories.

    I continued refining the layout, ensuring each component had a full preview, well-documented props, and example usages.  
    
    Once I reached a satisfying level of completeness, I considered the learning goals of the mentorship fulfilled.
