The mentorship was structured in two main phases: one focused on building foundational knowledge, and the other centered on applying that knowledge in a practical project.

Each phase followed a clear objective and learning approach, allowing me to progressively build up my skills in frontend development.

In the following pages, I describe the two phases in more detail and reflect on key challenges and takeaways from the overall learning journey.
