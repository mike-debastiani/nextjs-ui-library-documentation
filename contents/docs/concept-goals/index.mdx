## Concept
This mentorship project was designed to help me gain a deeper understanding of frontend development through hands-on experience. While my background lies primarily in UX/UI design, I wanted to close the gap between interface design and technical implementation by working directly with a modern web framework.

The core idea was to build a **personal UI component library** using **Next.js** and **Tailwind CSS**. By recreating common interface components from existing design systems or Figma libraries, I could both improve my technical skills and develop a deeper appreciation for how UI patterns are implemented in code.

Instead of focusing on a large, fully-featured application, I deliberately chose a **component-based approach**. This allowed me to concentrate on understanding the structure, styling, and behavior of each UI element individually. The goal of this mentorship was not to design a complete interface, but to strengthen my technical frontend skills through focused, hands-on development.

## Goals

The main goals of this mentorship were:

- To deepen my knowledge of JavaScript, React, and especially Next.js.
- To practice building reusable frontend components with real-world application.
- To understand the workflow of modern component-based development.
- To improve my ability to structure and document a scalable design system.
- To build a reference library that I can reuse or extend in future projects.

This focused, hands-on format helped me grow as a designer who codes â€“ and as a developer who designs with purpose.
