# Next.js UI Component Library

This is a personal UI component library built with **Next.js**, **Tailwind CSS**, and **TypeScript**.  
It was developed as part of a mentoring project at the Lucerne University of Applied Sciences and Arts (HSLU) in the module **MENT4.FS25**.

## About the Project

The goal of this project was to deepen my frontend development skills by building a reusable UI component library from scratch.  
Each component is documented with usage guidelines, props, examples, and code previews â€” all accessible through a custom-built documentation website.

This project was created and maintained by **Mike De Bastiani**, mentored by **Nick Niles**.

## Features

- Built with [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) (App Router)
- Styled using [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/)
- All components are documented with [MDX](https://mdxjs.com/)
- Live component previews with toggleable code blocks
- Fully responsive layout and accessible components
